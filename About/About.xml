  <description>A mod that changes the default behavior of the sun lamp and hydroponic basins.

    Changes:
    * Sun Lamps
      - Increased radius
      - Doesn't turn off at night
      - Outputs much more heat
    * Hydroponic Basins
      - Decreased cost, allowing 16 basins and a Sun Lamp from a single Geothermal Power Generator
      - Plants in basins don't rest at night (growing 24/7!)
